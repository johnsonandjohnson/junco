## Overview

The junco R package contains analysis functions to create tables and listings used for clinical trial reporting.
It complements the tern package by providing additional statistical analysis capabilities.

The package provides a range of functionality, such as:

- Statistical analysis (ANCOVA, MMRM, Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier)
- Calculation of odds ratios, relative risks, and proportion differences
- Event incidence rate analysis
- Frequency tabulations and summarizations
- Reference-based multiple imputation (RBMI) for handling missing data
- Production-ready RTF exporter for listings and tables (see [tt_to_tbldf](https://johnsonandjohnson.github.io/junco/reference/tt_to_tlgrtf.html))
- Creation of tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs)
