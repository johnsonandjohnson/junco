\title{Extract Least Square Means from `MMRM`}
\usage{
get_mmrm_lsmeans(fit, vars, conf_level, weights, averages = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{(`mmrm`)\cr result of [mmrm::mmrm()].}

\item{vars}{(named `list` of `string` or `character`)\cr specifying the variables in the `MMRM`.
  The following elements need to be included as character vectors and match corresponding columns
  in `data`:

  - `response`: the response variable.
  - `covariates`: the additional covariate terms (might also include interactions).
  - `id`: the subject ID variable.
  - `arm`: the treatment group variable (factor).
  - `visit`: the visit variable (factor).
  - `weights`: optional weights variable (if `NULL` or omitted then no weights will be used).

  Note that the main effects and interaction of `arm` and `visit` are by default
  included in the model.}

\item{conf_level}{(`proportion`)\cr confidence level of the interval.}

\item{weights}{(`string`)\cr type of weights to be used for the least square means,
see [emmeans::emmeans()] for details.}

\item{averages}{(`list`)\cr named list of visit levels which should be averaged
and reported along side the single visits.}
}
\value{
A list with data frames `estimates` and `contrasts`.
  The attributes `averages` and `weights` save the settings used.
}
\description{
Extracts the least square means from an `MMRM` fit.
