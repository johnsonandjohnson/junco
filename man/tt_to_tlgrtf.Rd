\arguments{
\item{tt}{TableTree object to convert to RTF}

\item{file}{character(1). File to create, including path, but excluding
.rtf extension.}

\item{orientation}{Orientation of the output ("portrait" or "landscape")}

\item{colwidths}{Column widths for the table}

\item{label_width_ins}{Label width in inches}

\item{watermark}{(optional) String containing the desired watermark for
RTF outputs. Vectorized.}

\item{pagenum}{(optional) Logical. When true page numbers are added on the
right side of the footer section in the format page x/y.
Vectorized. (Default = FALSE)}

\item{fontspec}{Font specification object}

\item{pg_width}{Page width in inches}

\item{margins}{Margins in inches (top, right, bottom, left)}

\item{paginate}{Whether to paginate the output}

\item{col_gap}{Column gap in spaces}

\item{nosplitin}{list(row=, col=). Path elements whose children should not be paginated within
if it can be avoided. e.g., list(col="TRT01A") means don't split within treatment arms unless
all the associated columns don't fit on a single page.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print verbose output}

\item{tlgtype}{Type of the output (Table, Listing, or Figure)}

\item{string_map}{Unicode mapping for special characters}

\item{markup_df}{Data frame containing markup information}

\item{combined_rtf}{logical(1). In the case where the result is broken up into multiple
parts due to width, should a combined rtf file also be created. Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{one_table}{logical(1). If `tt` is a (non-`MatrixPrintForm`) list,
should the parts be added to the rtf within a single table (`TRUE`, the
default) or as separate tables. End users will not generally need to set this.}

\item{border_mat}{matrix. A `m x k` matrix where m is the number of columns of `tt`
and k is the number of lines the header takes up. See [tidytlg::add_bottom_borders]
for what the matrix should contain. Users should only specify this when the
default behavior does not meet their needs.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to gentlg}
}
\description{
A function to convert TableTree to .rtf
}
\details{
This function aids in converting the rtables TableTree into the desired .rtf file.
}
\note{
`file` should always include path. Path will be extracted
and passed separately to `gentlg`.

When `one_table` is `FALSE`, only the width of the row label
  pseudocolumn can be directly controlled due to a limitation in
  `tidytlg::gentlg`. The proportion of the full page that the first value
  in colwidths would take up is preserved and all other columns equally
  split the remaining available width. This will cause, e.g., the
  elements within the allparts rtf generated when `combined_rtf` is `TRUE`
  to differ visually from the content of the individual part rtfs.
