\usage{
fit_mmrm_j(
  vars = list(response = "AVAL", covariates = c(), id = "USUBJID", arm = "ARM", visit =
    "AVISIT"),
  data,
  conf_level = 0.95,

  averages_emmeans = list(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{(named `list` of `string` or `character`)\cr specifying the variables in the `MMRM`.
  The following elements need to be included as character vectors and match corresponding columns
  in `data`:

  - `response`: the response variable.
  - `covariates`: the additional covariate terms (might also include interactions).
  - `id`: the subject ID variable.
  - `arm`: the treatment group variable (factor).
  - `visit`: the visit variable (factor).
  - `weights`: optional weights variable (if `NULL` or omitted then no weights will be used).

  Note that the main effects and interaction of `arm` and `visit` are by default
  included in the model.}

\item{data}{(`data.frame`)\cr with all the variables specified in
`vars`. Records with missing values in any independent variables
will be excluded.}

\item{conf_level}{(`proportion`)\cr confidence level of the interval.}

\item{cor_struct}{(`string`)\cr specifying the covariance structure, defaults to
`'unstructured'`. See the details.}

\item{weights_emmeans}{(`string`)\cr argument from [emmeans::emmeans()], `'counterfactual'` by default.}

\item{averages_emmeans}{(`list`)\cr optional named list of visit levels which should be averaged
and reported along side the single visits.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for [mmrm::mmrm()], in particular `reml` and options listed in
[mmrm::mmrm_control()].}
}
\value{
A `tern_model` object which is a list with model results:

  - `fit`: The `mmrm` object which was fitted to the data. Note that via `mmrm::component(fit, 'optimizer')`
      the finally used optimization algorithm can be obtained, which can be useful for refitting the model
      later on.
  - `cov_estimate`: The matrix with the covariance matrix estimate.
  - `diagnostics`: A list with model diagnostic statistics (REML criterion, AIC, corrected AIC, BIC).
  - `lsmeans`: This is a list with data frames `estimates` and `contrasts`.
       The attributes `averages` and `weights` save the settings used
       (`averages_emmeans` and `weights_emmeans`).
  - `vars`: The variable list.
  - `labels`: Corresponding list with variable labels extracted from `data`.
  - `cor_struct`: input.
  - `ref_level`: The reference level for the arm variable, which is always the first level.
  - `treatment_levels`: The treatment levels for the arm variable.
  - `conf_level`: The confidence level which was used to construct the `lsmeans` confidence intervals.
  - `additional`: List with any additional inputs passed via `...`
}
\description{
Does the `MMRM` analysis. Multiple other functions can be called on the result to produce
tables and graphs.
}
\details{
Multiple different degree of freedom adjustments are available via the `method` argument
  for [mmrm::mmrm()]. In addition, covariance matrix adjustments are available via `vcov`.
  Please see [mmrm::mmrm_control()] for details and additional useful options.

  For the covariance structure (`cor_struct`), the user can choose among the following options.

  - `unstructured`: Unstructured covariance matrix. This is the most flexible choice and default.
       If there are `T` visits, then `T * (T+1) / 2` variance parameters are used.
  - `toeplitz`: Homogeneous Toeplitz covariance matrix, which uses `T` variance parameters.
  - `heterogeneous toeplitz`: Heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance matrix,
       which uses `2 * T - 1` variance parameters.
  - `ante-dependence`: Homogeneous Ante-Dependence covariance matrix, which uses `T` variance parameters.
  - `heterogeneous ante-dependence`: Heterogeneous Ante-Dependence covariance matrix,
       which uses `2 * T - 1` variance parameters.
  - `auto-regressive`: Homogeneous Auto-Regressive (order 1) covariance matrix,
       which uses 2 variance parameters.
  - `heterogeneous auto-regressive`: Heterogeneous Auto-Regressive (order 1) covariance matrix,
       which uses `T + 1` variance parameters.
  - `compound symmetry`: Homogeneous Compound Symmetry covariance matrix, which uses 2
       variance parameters.
  - `heterogeneous compound symmetry`: Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry covariance matrix, which uses
       `T + 1` variance parameters.

\note{
This function has the `_j` suffix to distinguish it from [mmrm::fit_mmrm()].
  It is a copy from the `tern.mmrm` package and later will be replaced by [tern.mmrm::fit_mmrm()].
  No new features are included in this function here.
