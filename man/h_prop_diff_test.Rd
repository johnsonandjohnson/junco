\title{Helper functions to test proportion differences}
\usage{
prop_chisq(tbl, alternative)

prop_cmh(ary, alternative)

prop_fisher(tbl, alternative)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{(`matrix`)\cr matrix with two groups in rows and the binary response (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) in columns.}

\item{ary}{(`array`, 3 dimensions)\cr array with two groups in rows, the binary response
(`TRUE`/`FALSE`) in columns, and the strata in the third dimension.}
}
\value{
A p-value.
}
\description{
Helper functions to implement various tests on the difference between two proportions.
}
\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{prop_chisq()}: Performs Chi-Squared test. Internally calls [stats::prop.test()].

\item \code{prop_cmh()}: Performs stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.
Internally calls [stats::mantelhaen.test()].

\item \code{prop_fisher()}: Performs the Fisher's exact test. Internally calls [stats::fisher.test()].

}}
\note{
strata with less than five observations will result in a warning and
 possibly incorrect results; strata with less than two observations are
 automatically discarded.
