\usage{
lsmeans_wide_cfun(
  df,
  labelstr,
  .spl_context,
  variables,
  ref_level,
  treatment_levels,
  pval_sided = c("2", "1", "-1"),
  conf_level,
  formats
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(`data.frame`)\cr data set containing all analysis variables.}

\item{labelstr}{(`character`)\cr label of the level of the parent split currently being summarized
(must be present as second argument in Content Row Functions). See [rtables::summarize_row_groups()]
for more information.}

\item{.spl_context}{(`data.frame`)\cr gives information about ancestor split states
that is passed by `rtables`.}

\item{variables}{(`list`)\cr see [fit_ancova()] for required variable
specifications.}

\item{ref_level}{(`string`)\cr the reference level of the treatment arm variable.}

\item{treatment_levels}{(`character`)\cr the non-reference levels of the treatment arm
variable.}

\item{pval_sided}{(`string`)\cr either '2' for two-sided or '1' for 1-sided with greater than
control or '-1' for 1-sided with smaller than control alternative hypothesis.}

\item{conf_level}{(`proportion`)\cr confidence level of the interval.}

\item{formats}{(`list`)\cr including `lsmean`, `mse`, `df`, `lsmean_diff`, `se`,
`ci`, `pval` formats.}
