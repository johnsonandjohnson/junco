\title{Summary Analysis Function for Compliance Columns (TEFSCNCMP01 e.g.)}
\usage{
cmp_cfun(df, labelstr, .spl_context, variables, formats)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(`data.frame`)\cr data set containing all analysis variables.}

\item{labelstr}{(`character`)\cr label of the level of the parent split currently being summarized
(must be present as second argument in Content Row Functions). See [rtables::summarize_row_groups()]
for more information.}

\item{.spl_context}{(`data.frame`)\cr gives information about ancestor split states
that is passed by `rtables`.}

\item{variables}{(`list`)\cr with variable names of logical columns for
`expected`, `received` and `missing` visits.}

\item{formats}{(`list`)\cr with the `count_percent` format to use for the received
and missing visits columns.}
}
\value{
The [rtables::in_rows()] result with the counts and proportion statistics.
}
\description{
A simple statistics function which prepares the numbers with percentages
  in the required format, for use in a split content row. The denominator here is
  from the expected visits column.
}
\details{
Although this function just returns `NULL` it has two uses, for
  the `tern` users it provides a documentation of arguments that are
  commonly and consistently used in the framework. For the developer it adds a
  single reference point to import the `roxygen` argument description with:
  `@inheritParams proposal_argument_convention`
}
\seealso{
[cmp_post_fun()] for the corresponding split function.
