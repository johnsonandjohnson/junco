\usage{
rbmi_pool(
  results,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  type = c("percentile", "normal")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{an analysis object created by \code{\link[=analyse]{analyse()}}.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the returned confidence interval.
Must be a single number between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of \code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}.}

\item{type}{a character string of either \code{"percentile"} (default) or
\code{"normal"}. Determines what method should be used to calculate the bootstrap
confidence intervals. See details.
Only used if \code{method_condmean(type = "bootstrap")} was specified
in the original call to draws().}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{pool}.

Pool analysis results obtained from the imputed datasets

\details{
This has been forked from the \code{rbmi} package, mainly to support in
addition the pooling of variance estimates. See \code{\link[=pool]{pool()}} for more details.
