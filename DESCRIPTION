Description: Structure and formatting requirements for clinical trial table and listing outputs
    vary between pharmaceutical companies. 'junco' provides additional tooling for use alongside
    the 'rtables', 'rlistings' and 'tern' packages when creating table and listing outputs. While
    motivated by the specifics of Johnson and Johnson Clinical and Statistical Programming's
    table and listing shells, 'junco' provides functionality that is general and reusable.
    Major features include a) alternative and extended statistical analyses beyond what 'tern'
    supports for use in standard safety and efficacy tables, b) a robust production-grade
    Rich Text Format (RTF) exporter for both tables and listings, c) structural support
    for spanning column headers and risk difference columns in tables, and d) robust
    font-aware automatic column width algorithms for both listings and tables.
